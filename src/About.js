                <p>
                    I am a recent BCA graduate from MG University and a dedicated Python developer with a strong foundation in web development, 
                    specializing in Django, React, and database management. My expertise extends to data structures, algorithms, 
                    and the ability to deliver high-quality solutions through effective time management and task prioritization. 
                    I am also passionate about Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity, 
                    using this knowledge to drive innovation and enhance security in the projects I undertake.
